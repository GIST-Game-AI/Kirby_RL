In the input, the game is divided into a Platform stage and a Boss stage. In the Platform stage, the objective is to get to the right end of the map and get the Star, and in the Boss stage, the objective is to reduce the Boss's Health to 0 by not hitting the objects thrown by the Boss, and Kirby sucking them up and spitting them back out to attack.
